# IDEAS

* open qutebrowser hints in number form, turn pad into passthrough for numbers
* open browser to current clipboard (`pp` in qutebrowser)

Rewrote config parsing to use traditional {} blocks instead of indents.

Working on typing for text snippits, hopefully done tonight.

Next macro will be extending the browser mode to use qutebrowser's hint via
numbers. Looking into a type of layer that resets the layer timeout each time a
button is pressed within it to make this mode possible.

Established mode layers. Now have web browser binds for scrolling, page up/down,
navigating tabs, and going fw/bk in history.

Should look into snippits more. Also more terminal operations
